# Project Title: Airbnb Listings Analysis

## Overview
Project 4 is the final project for the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Our group has chosen to focus on Airbnb listings using the **Airbnb Open Dataset** based in **New York, USA**. This project aims to provide travel insights for consumers and business insights for entrepreneurs who may want to get involved with Airbnb or other similar companies.

## Objectives
- **Data Enhancement**: We have incorporated open-source data from **2022 to 2024** to enrich our analysis, enabling additional insights and machine learning predictive capabilities.
- **Field Analysis**: Key fields of interest include:
  - **Location Information**: Useful for mapping and identifying popular areas.
  - **Rental Prices**: Analyzing pricing trends across different neighborhoods.
  - **Minimum Stay Requirements**: Understanding rental policies and their implications for travelers.
  - **Availability**: Assessing seasonal trends in rental availability throughout the year.
  - **Host Listings and Reviews**: Evaluating host performance and customer satisfaction.
  - **Machine Learning**: Exploration of regression models (linear vs tree) in addtion the application of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R^2 score comparison for Test Data. 

## Dataset
The original dataset required minimal cleaning, making it straightforward to work with. 
Additional open-source data sets were added for comparison with ease of adding on future datasets for further analysis over time.

## Conclusion
This project not only enhances our understanding of Airbnb listings but also equips us with valuable skills in data analytics and visualization that can be applied in real-world business scenarios.
