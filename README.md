Project 4 is the final project for the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Our group has chosen Airbnb listings. This Airbnb Open Dataset is based in New York, USA. This project involves travel for consumers and business insight for entrepreneurs who may want to get involved with Airbnb or other similar companies. We were able to add in open source data between 2022 and 2024 to allow for additional insight and machine learning and predictive capabilities. Fields of interest for this project include the location information for mapping, prices on rentals, and minimum number of nights required to rent as well as availability throughout the year, and information on the hostâ€™s listings and reviews of the locations. Minimal cleaning is needed for this dataset and a comparison dataset can easily be added in for predictive qualities over time if desired.

# Project 4: Airbnb Listings Analysis

## Overview
Project 4 is the final project for the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Our group has chosen to focus on Airbnb listings using the **Airbnb Open Dataset** based in **New York, USA**. This project aims to provide travel insights for consumers and business insights for entrepreneurs who may want to get involved with Airbnb or other similar companies.

## Objectives
- **Data Enhancement**: We have incorporated open-source data from **2022 to 2024** to enrich our analysis, enabling additional insights and machine learning predictive capabilities.
- **Field Analysis**: Key fields of interest include:
  - **Location Information**: Useful for mapping and identifying popular areas.
  - **Rental Prices**: Analyzing pricing trends across different neighborhoods.
  - **Minimum Stay Requirements**: Understanding rental policies and their implications for travelers.
  - **Availability**: Assessing seasonal trends in rental availability throughout the year.
  - **Host Listings and Reviews**: Evaluating host performance and customer satisfaction.
  - **Machine Learning**: Exploration of regrgession models (linear vs tree) in addtion the application of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R^2 score comparison for Test Data. 

## Dataset
The dataset requires minimal cleaning, making it straightforward to work with. Additionally, a comparison dataset can easily be integrated for predictive analysis over time if desired. 

## Conclusion
This project not only enhances our understanding of Airbnb listings but also equips us with valuable skills in data analytics and visualization that can be applied in real-world business scenarios.
