Project 4 is the final project for the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Our group has chosen Airbnb listings. This Airbnb Open Dataset is based in New York, USA. This project involves travel for consumers and business insight for entrepreneurs who may want to get involved with Airbnb or other similar companies. We were able to add in open source data between 2022 and 2024 to allow for additional insight and machine learning and predictive capabilities. Fields of interest for this project include the location information for mapping, prices on rentals, and minimum number of nights required to rent as well as availability throughout the year, and information on the hostâ€™s listings and reviews of the locations. Minimal cleaning is needed for this dataset and a comparison dataset can easily be added in for predictive qualities over time if desired.
